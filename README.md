# uci-scraper
Scraping tool for UCI datasets.

This project is created with the intention of automatically scraping links and downloading regression datasets from the UCI repository.

One caveat: there is a lack of structure in how the links are presented so for this tool to work effectively, we need to enter the links of the first and the last datasets manually.

More instructions later.
